I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of Prof. Hongxia Wang at Sichuan University (SCU), Chengdu, China. Previously, from 2017-2020, I finished my M.S. degree in Computer Technology from Liaoning university of Technology where I conducted Priacy protection research and developed privacy models to support data publishing. I started my academic career in Computer Technology, with a Bachelor's degree in Internet of Things Engineering from Liaoning university of Technology, Liaoning. Outside of Information Security, I like learning about Basketball, Music, Reading, and Travel.
