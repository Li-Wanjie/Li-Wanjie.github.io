<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Adaptive image steganography is the process of embedding secret messages into undetectable regions of a cover image through the design of a distortion function by a steganographer. Since the state-of-the-art steganalyzers are mainly based on image residual analysis, it is reasonable to modify stego image for withstanding steganalysis by reducing or eliminating the image residual distance between cover and stego image. However, simply modifying stego images may lead to message extraction failure and the introduction of additional detectable artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel secure steganography strategy by constructing immunized stego-image via an artificial immune system, called ISteg, which ensures the accurate extraction of hidden data while enhancing the security against steganalyzers. Inspired by the biological immune system, we use an artificial immune system (AIS) to build ISteg. Specifically, ISteg generates the immunized stego-image by automatically modifying the stego to maximize the affinity of the antibody. The affinity is developed to evaluate antibody quality according to the Euclidean distance between the residual co-occurrence matrix features of the cover image and the modified stego image. In this manner, the so-called immunized stego-image is generated. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ISteg strategy can effectively improve the security performance of existing steganography.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The cost function is crucial to the security of adaptive image steganography, However, some existing cost functions are heuristically designed and hard to be optimal in the undetectability against the evolving steganalyzer. In this letter, we propose a cost reassignment algorithm for adaptive steganography based on artificial immune system. Under the scenario of minimizing additive distortion, this method reassigns the cost by adjusting the modification probability distribution obtained by the cost function, and dynamically optimizes the adjustment mode through the immunity-based information hiding model, so that the modified pixels are more concentrated in the regions that are difficult to be detected. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for a variety of the state-of-the-art cost functions and can achieve better performance on resisting the steganalysis.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Privacy protection in data publishing is an extremely important issue that has been the focus of extensive research in recent years. However, the existing methods have a host of limitations, especially for high-dimensional data publishing. Aiming at the problem of poor availability of publishing results caused by “the curse of dimensionality” in high-dimensional data publishing, we present PPDP-PCAO (Privacy Preserving Data Publishing with Principal Component Analysis Optimization) method, which can better address the problem of the lower utility of release results because of the high noise introduced by the curse of dimensionality. PPDP-PCAO improves the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm by employing the attribute importance, and reduces the dimension of the data with the improved PCA, which reduces the time and space cost. PPDP-PCAO introduces the evaluation mechanism based on mutual-information into data release, which evaluates the data generated by setting the different quantities of principal components to determine the optimal quantities. PPDP-PCAO considers the existence of multi-sensitive attributes in high-dimensional data, while the traditional methods of allocating privacy budgets cannot satisfy the personalized privacy protection. PPDP-PCAO introduces the sensitivity preference, combines the optimal matching theory, and designs the sensitive attribute hierarchical protection strategy. Extensive experimental results on different real datasets demonstrate that PPDP-PCAO not only guarantees the privacy of published dataset, but also significantly improves the accuracy and data utility than other high-dimensional data publishing methods.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Data fusion release can provide users with more effective statistical results and more personalized services. The existing data fusion model mainly adopts k-anonymity privacy protection method,which does not take into account the impact of data user’s authority and importance on data privacy,resulting in the serious leakage of privacy data and a serious decline in data quality. To solve this problem,a data hierarchical fusion publishing mechanism based on differential privacy protection（ HDFPM） is proposed. This mechanism classifies users’ rights and payment. In the process of data fusion,differential privacy protection technology is combined with the classification tree and its improved algorithm to perform data fusion,and the hierarchical differential privacy budget is reasonably distributed to realize the classification of fusion data privacy protection. Experimental results show that this mechanism can not only realize effective data fusion,but also protect sensitive data.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Point of interest recommendation algorithm collects the user’s history behavior records, infers the user’s preference according to the collected record, and recommends the new point of interest to the user according to the user’s preference. In the process of traditional interest point of recommendation, the privacy information of the user is easy to be leaked. In order to avoid this situation, the differential privacy protection mechanism was used to protect the user information from malicious attack. The implementation mechanisms of differential privacy protection mainly included exponential mechanism and Laplace mechanism, both of which were used in geographic privacy protection algorithms. The geographical location privacy protection algorithm based on differential privacy protection established a location search tree by the relationship between the records in the dataset. Then the frequently visited k-item records were selected by using the exponential mechanism and the structure of the tree. Finally, Laplace noise was added to the k-item records, and the location search tree after the noise was published. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively protect users’ privacy information when the recommendation effect is invariant.</p>

<strong>From Cover to Immucover: Adversarial Steganography via Immunized Cover Construction</strong>, <i>IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems(T-FS)</i><br>with <b>Wanjie Li</b>;Hongxia Wang;Yijing Chen;<br>
<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Recent advancements in image steganography demonstrate that reasonable cover enhancement approaches can effectively improve the security performance of steganography. However, existing proposals based on adversarial steganography against targeted steganalyzers are insufficient in terms of eliminating or reducing anomalous pixels caused by subsequent embedding. This limitation impedes the full potential of cover enhancement schemes for enhancing steganographic security. In this paper, we present Immucover, a novel immunized cover image construction method that leverages fuzzy enhancement and an artificial immune system (AIS) to incorporate texture region- and edge region-adaptive enhancement. Specifically, we first design a parameterized method to adaptively enhance the texture region of the given cover image using a distortion function. Then, Immucover detects and enhances the edge region of the cover image using a fuzzy-parameterized approach based on an optimized smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus (USAN) for edge detection. Finally, a powerful AIS module acts as an optimizer to optimize the parameters that affect the texture and edge area, i.e., the area where the secret information is suitably embedded. In this way, a so-called immunized cover image is generated. In addition, we develop a novel affinity metric to assess the antibody quality within the AIS module, which guides the generation of the immunized cover with higher security. Comprehensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that our Immucover provides significantly improved resistance to steganalysis and enhances the security of steganography.</p>
